The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.
In this project you will use various classification algorithms on bankruptcy dataset to predict bankruptcies with satisfying accuracies long before the actual event.
